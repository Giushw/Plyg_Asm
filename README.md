# Plyg_Asm
Test Landing Page

## Intro
Hi this is the Assignmet, I've done this week.
It's pretty simple to use after you spend some minute to read this quick guide.
Actually is a Vue Cli project to spped up the ambient creation with some add-ons.

## Getting started
To start and see the project for making things quick i suggest to:
- From the project folder **Plyg_Asm**, move into the folder **plyg_lnd**;
- There use **npm install**, to install locally the project.

Then you can choose 2 ways:
### Short One
- run **npm run serve** and open the http://localhost:8080/ into the browser;

### Longer one
- run **vue ui** to use the vue VueCli dashboard;
- open the **Plyg_Asm/plyg_lnd** priject;
- open the **task** view on the left menu;
- run the **serve** task;
- OPTIONAL: before run serve use the parameter option to customize the port or the browser autopening on ready;

## Add-on
